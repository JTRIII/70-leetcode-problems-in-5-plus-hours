# [70 Leetcode Problems in 5+ hours (every data structure) (full tutorial)](https://youtu.be/lvO88XxNAzs?si=x2mqzqDpHVhAaKDJ)

I am following this tutorial on YouTube to get better at leetcode and Data Structures and Algorithms. 

# Leetcode Overview

1.  Big O - space and time complexities. Understanding the mechanics of an algorithm
2.  Problems:
    -  Arrays, Arrays Two Pointers, Arrays Sliding Window
    -  Bit Manipulation
    -  Dynamic Programming
    -  Backtracking
    -  Linked Lists
    -  Stacks
    -  Queues
    -  Binary Trees
    -  Binary Search Trees
    -  Heaps
    -  Graphs

# Steps for Getting Into Big Tech Companies

0. Mental Focus
    - You need to be able to sit down and work for 2 hours straight uninterrupted
        - Most content has camera cuts every 2-3 seconds. It is not make for us to have long attention spans
        - When most of start any task, within a few minutes we are looking at our phone and scrolling through TikTok or Instagram
    - A great way to do this is to make a list of steps you take before starting your study session.
        - Example steps before focus work:
            - Get everything ready to prevent interruption:
                - Water/Tea/Coffee
                - Pre-bathroom break
                - Chargers
                - Pen and Paper
            - Remove Distractions:
                - Put phone somwehre else/switch it off
                - Tell others/be prepared to tell them you aare working or to come back later
            - Plan what you will be working on
            - Set a timer for 2-3 hours
            - Get in a learning/working headspace
            - Be mindful
            - Meditate for a minute beforehand
            - Play music with no lyrics
    - You will be amazed with how doing this will improve your mental focus and ability to learn

1. Learn a programming language. 
    - I would suggest Python as its the easiest beginner language, and easiest to work with when preparing for and taking an interview. It's also widely applicable. 
    - It also has a wide range of specialities:
        - Web development
        - Data Analysis
        - Machine learning
    - A good course to learn python is [The Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/?srsltid=AfmBOopCHJnSHqBQEasDP2IBDwXzkV9plC-jrZQL-X8dTm-czJmqOUkN&couponCode=MT251022G2) on Udemy
        - It is a paid course, but paid courses are usually better because they have better content. Also, since you put some investment in them, you are more than likely going to finish them.
    - Once you know what Object Oriented Programming is with concepts like classes, inheritance, and abstraction. You should be good
    - Also try to create some simple programs by yourself like Rock, Paper, Scissors

2. Learn Data Structures and Algorithms
    - Data Structures are more important than Algorithms becuase in an interview you will more than likely be asked to implement a DS than an Alg form scratch. 

3. Complete Leetcode/Programming problem practice
    - The video tutorial I'm following completes this step

4. Software Engineering Concepts

5. Behavioural Practice

6. Best Methods of Applying

7. Interview Process and Internal Guidelines
