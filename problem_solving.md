# Process for Problem Solving 

- Read the problem twice to understant it - (ask clarifying questions)
- Try to think basically of different ways to solve problem
    - Verbalize your thought process
    - You can always start with the brute force approach. 
    - Then you can start to pick one of your solutions and refine it to be efficient. 
- Think end-to-end (E2E) of the best solutions based on complexity
    - "If I had an hour to solve a problem I'd spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions. - Albert Einstein"
    - Recommended to put pen to paper and try to draw out the problem and solutions with pseudocode to go with it
        - This helps you visualize the problem and solution and see any steps you might be missing
- Write the Algorithm from patterns in drawing
- Code it out
- Try and improve it once you think you're finished
- Go through other solutions (even if you answered correctly)
    - Don't always follow the top solution on leetcode because people have taken the competitive programming approach by fitting as much complex code into one line as they can to get a solution.
    - You want your code to be readable because interviewers will want to be able to read it clearly and understand what you have written.
    - Look at solutions that have readable code and good descriptions about the problem.


\* This is the process *stony codes* uses for solving leetcode problems. Everyone is different and it is important to try and find your own way to solve problems.
